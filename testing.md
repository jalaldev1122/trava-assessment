# Automated Testing

---

## 1. Types of Tests to Automate

### Unit Tests

Unit tests validate individual components and functions of the system. The core functions that need unit tests are:

- URL Shortening Logic (`shorten_url`)

  - Test that a URL with filters is correctly shortened to a valid short URL.
  - Handle edge cases such as large URL lengths or special characters.

- URL Retrieval Logic (`retrieve_url`)
  - Test that the system correctly retrieves the original URL based on the short hash.
  - Handle cases with invalid or expired short URLs.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests ensure that the different parts of the system work together as expected:

- Shorten URL Service Endpoint (`POST /shorten`)
  - Test that sending a URL with filters results in a valid shortened URL.
  - Handle multiple filters and ensure that the generated URL is correct.
  - Test boundary cases, such as the maximum number of filters.
- Retrieve Original URL Service (`GET /get-original-url`)
  - Test that the backend correctly maps the shortened URL back to the original long URL with the correct filters.
  - Handle both valid and invalid short URLs (e.g., expired URLs, malformed URLs).

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

End-to-end tests ensure the entire user flow works correctly:

- URL Creation and Sharing

  - Test the complete flow of shortening a URL, sharing it, and retrieving it. Ensure filters are correctly applied in both cases.

- Cache Integration

  - Test the interaction between the backend, database, and cache. Ensure that cache hits and misses are handled correctly.

- Database Cleanup
  - Verify that URLs not accessed for the defined period (e.g., 30 days) are cleaned up from the database and cache.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate how the system behaves under heavy load:

- URL Shortening Speed Test
  - Simulate high numbers of users creating shortened URLs and assess the system’s performance under load.
- URL Retrieval Speed Test
  - Test the retrieval speed for shortened URLs under high traffic, ensuring scalability.

### Security Tests

Security tests ensure the system is protected against potential threats:

- SQL Injection Tests
  - Ensure the system is secure against SQL injection attacks.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Tests

  - Ensure the system is protected from XSS vulnerabilities.

- Rate Limiting Tests
  - Verify that rate-limiting mechanisms are in place to prevent abuse.

## 2. Tools for Automating Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests:

- Jest
  - A popular testing framework for JavaScript, useful for unit and integration tests. Use Jest for testing backend logic and functions.
  - Jest Mocking: Mock external services, such as database calls, during tests.
  - Supertest: A library to test HTTP requests, ideal for testing API endpoints.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests:

- Cypress
  - An E2E testing framework that runs in the browser, simulating real user interactions.
  - Test the full flow of shortening, sharing, and retrieving URLs.
- Selenium WebDriver
  - A more advanced tool for simulating browser interactions, useful for more complex testing.

### Performance Tests:

- Artillery
  - A modern tool for load testing APIs and websites. We can use it to simulate high traffic and evaluate performance.
- JMeter
  - Another widely-used performance testing tool, suitable for testing large-scale systems.

### Security Tests:

- OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
  - A tool for automatically scanning for security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- Burp Suite
  - Another powerful security testing tool for detecting vulnerabilities in web applications.

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Deployment (CD) Integration

To automate the execution of our tests, we can integrate them into our CI/CD pipeline. Here's how we can set this up:

### GitHub Actions (or similar CI tool)

We can set up GitHub Actions (or another CI tool like GitLab CI or Jenkins) to run unit tests on each pull request or code push. This ensures that no new changes break existing functionality.

Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Jest tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npx cypress run
```

### Test Coverage Reporting

We can use Jest’s built-in coverage tool to generate coverage reports and ensure that a significant portion of your codebase is covered by automated tests.

Example:

```
jest --coverage
```

We can set up coverage thresholds in the CI pipeline to fail the build if coverage drops below a certain percentage (e.g., 90%).

## 4. Monitoring and Test Maintenance

As the solution evolves, it’s important to:

- Update Test Cases: Continuously add and update tests for new features or changes to the system.
- Mock Dependencies: Ensure external dependencies (e.g., databases, third-party APIs) are mocked during tests to avoid failures.
- Monitor Test Results: Regularly check the results of the tests to quickly identify and fix failures, whether caused by new code or infrastructure changes.

## 5. Steps for Automation Implementation:

1. Set up testing frameworks (Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests, Artillery for performance tests).
2. Write comprehensive test cases for all key parts of the system (encoding, decoding, URL shortening, and retrieval).
3. Run tests regularly to ensure the solution continues to work as expected.
4. Monitor coverage to ensure high code quality.
5. Run performance tests periodically to validate that the system scales with traffic.
