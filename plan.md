# Planning

## Breaking the work into Milestones

To ensure smooth execution, Iâ€™d break the project into clear milestones based on dependencies and risk factors.

## Milestone 1: Backend API Development

### Goal

Build the core URL shortening backend.

### Tasks

- Set up PostgreSQL and Redis.
- Implement URL shortening and retrieval endpoints (/shorten, /get-original-url).
- Implement cleanup mechanism for expired URLs (/cleanup).
- Add logging and monitoring for API requests.
- Write unit tests for core functionalities.

### Deliverable:

Fully functional backend service with basic API documentation.

## Milestone 2: Frontend Integration

### Goal

Enable frontend users to generate & share short URLs.

### Tasks

- Implement UI changes to support URL shortening.
- Call backend API to shorten URLs.
- Handle URL redirection from short links.
- Add copy-to-clipboard feature for easy sharing.
- Write frontend unit tests for the feature.

### Deliverable:

Working frontend integration for shortening and sharing URLs.

## Milestone 3: Performance & Security Enhancements

### Goal

Improve system reliability and security.

### Tasks

- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Implement malicious URL detection before shortening.
- Optimize database queries for faster lookups.
- Improve cache management to avoid unnecessary DB hits.
- Deploy API monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry).

### Deliverables

Secure and optimized backend ready for production.

## Milestone 4 - Deployment & Scaling Considerations

### Goal

Deploy the service and prepare for scale.

### Tasks:

- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Deploy backend on AWS/GCP with auto-scaling.
- Use Redis clustering for cache scalability.
- Implement load balancing for high traffic.
- Document system architecture and create a runbook.

### Deliverables

A production-ready, scalable URL shortening service.

# Prioritization

Iâ€™d use a prioritization framework like [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Wonâ€™t-have) to ensure we deliver the most critical features first.

| Priority       | Feature                                              | Reason                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŸ¥ Must-have   | URL Shortening API (/shorten, /get-original-url)     | Core functionality                    |
| ðŸŸ¥ Must-have   | PostgreSQL & Redis integration                       | Essential for storage & caching       |
| ðŸŸ§ Should-have | Cleanup mechanism for old URLs                       | Avoids database bloat                 |
| ðŸŸ§ Should-have | Frontend UI for sharing short URLs                   | Enhances user experience              |
| ðŸŸ¨ Could-have  | URL analytics (click tracking)                       | Useful for insights but not essential |
| ðŸŸ© Wonâ€™t-have  | (for now) Custom short URLs (e.g., cool.com/my-link) | Can be added later                    |

### Focus

- First, build a functional backend.
- Then, integrate it with the frontend.
- Finally, optimize performance and security.

# Scheduling

To deliver on time, Iâ€™d use Agile methodologies with sprints.

## Sprint Planning Example

Each sprint is 2 weeks long, and tasks are assigned based on complexity.

| Sprint            | Tasks                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sprint 1 - Week 1 | Set up DB Schemas, Redis, and core APIs (/shorten, /get-original-url), cache, and write unit tests (backend) |
| Sprint 1 - Week 2 | Frontend integration, UI updates, handle redirects, and write unit tests (frontend)                          |
| Sprint 2 - Week 1 | Security enhancements, performance optimizations, deployment to production                                   |
| Sprint 2 - Week 2 | Monitoring, scaling                                                                                          |

- Daily Standups for quick status updates.
- Weekly Sprint Reviews to track progress.
- Code Reviews & Testing before merging.

# Risk Management

To prevent delays, Iâ€™d identify potential risks early and have mitigation strategies.

| Risk                     | Impact | Mitigation                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| DB becomes overloaded    | High   | Use Redis caching, implement query optimizations    |
| Security vulnerabilities | High   | Implement validation, rate limiting, and monitoring |
| API latency is high      | Medium | Optimize backend queries, scale Redis & DB          |
| Feature scope expands    | Medium | Stick to MoSCoW prioritization                      |

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To ensure the solution is working well, Iâ€™d track the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

## System Performance Metrics

- Avg API response time (<200ms)
- Cache hit ratio (>90%)
- DB query execution time

## Usage Metrics

- Number of short URLs created
- Click-through rate (CTR) for shared URLs
- Most used filters (useful for product insights)

## Error Tracking

-API failure rate (<0.1%)
-Security alerts (e.g., blocked malicious URLs)
